HiLo

You will be given a number between 1-13. Your goal is to guess if the next card will be higher or lower.

click the up arrow to guess higher, and the down arrow for lower. Gain 100 points for being right, and lose 75 when wrong. 

You start with 300 points. You lose if you go to or below 0 points, and win if you get 1000 or more. Good luck.

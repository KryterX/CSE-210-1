RFK

Your task is to move around and find the cat. You are the "#" symbol, and the cat is a random symbol.

use "wasd" to move up, left, down, right respectively. Every symbol gives a random statment. 

Once the cat is found the screen will repopulate with new symbols and statments. Keep playing to your hearts content.

Have fun.
